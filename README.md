## To ClickTime Engineers
- This webapp was developed within approximately 1 day. As I am currently actively interviewing with many companies as well, I was unable to allocate additional time to the webapp. As such, I focused on functionality over design. There are some styling bugs and it doesn't look the preetiest, but I hope you can consider that I brought this up mostly within 1 day. Nonetheless, if you would like to comment on the project please feel free to reach out to me!
